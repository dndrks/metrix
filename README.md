# metrix

[intellijel Metropolix](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/metropolix/) for norns. ü§ñ‚ù§Ô∏è

All functionality and terms are directly adopted from metropolix. 
If you're not familiar with it, please have a look at the metropolix manual or do some binge watching on [yt](https://youtu.be/niP5hVB43_8). 
And, if you're looking for a nice and powerful eurorack sequencer, consider buying it of course. :)

## Features
- Two independent tracks with 8 stages each
- Control many functions directly via grid (pulse count, gate type, ratchets, pitch, octave, accumulation, slide and accent)
- Set playback direction (forward, reverse, alternate, random) and clock division (1/1 - 1/32) per track
- Loop the whole sequence or choose parts of it
- Quantize to a scale and root note via global params
- Connect to Crow or via MIDI
- Save and load up to 64 presets
- Generate random sequences 

## Requirements
- norns (210114)
- grid
- optional: crow

## Norns Keys and Encoders
- `K2` Play / Pause
- `K3` Reset and restart
- `Enc2` Select Track

## Grid Layout
The grid layout of **metrix** is strongly influenced by [skylines](https://llllllll.co/t/skylines/38856) and Kria. üôè

### Track Selector / Loopy
On pages 1 & 2, use the first two rows to select one of two tracks and to set the loop's start and end points:
- Tap on the currently unselected track to **select** it.
- Tap and hold the start point and select the end point to set the **looped stages**. This works in any direction.
- Tap on a stage on the currently selected track to select only a **single stage**.

### Page Selector
In the bottom left corner, you can choose among the following pages:

1. pulses and gates
2. pitch
3. presets and track settings

### Modifier Keys
In the bottom right corner, the `[shift]` and `[mod]` keys are located.
Hold these keys for secondary functions and shortcuts.

#### _shift_
Hold the `[shift]` key to switch to the secondary functions of a page. 
More on that on the corresponding sections. Also:

- `[shift] + [page 1] / [page 2]` 
**mute / unmute** tracks 1 and 2

#### _mod_
Hold the `[mod]` key to access some shortcuts:

- `[mod] + [page 1] / [page 2]`
**Randomize** the values related to that page
- `[mod] + [value]`
Set **all stages** to the selected value. Use the shift key additionally to access the secondary functions.
- `[mod] + [track selector]`
Set loopy to **repeat all stages** of the track

## Page 1: Pulses and gates
- Use the top matrix to choose the **pulse count** for each stage. 
- Use the bottom matrix to choose the **gate type** for each stage.
- Press and hold `[shift]` to access the matrices for **ratchets** (top) and **probability** (bottom).

<img src="docs/page1.gif" alt="Page 1: Pulses and gates" width="512" height="512">

## Page 2: Pitch
- Use the top matrix to choose the **pitch** for each stage. 
- Use the bottom matrix to choose the **octave** for each stage. Change the accessible octave range in the params.
- Press and hold `[shift]` to access the matrices for **accumulating transposition** (top), **slide** on/off and **accent** on/off (bottom).

Notes: 
  - As the currenty used engine supports **slide** only as a global command, it affects both tracks if using the built-in audio.
  - ~~**accent** is only available for MIDI right now (#17)~~
  - **slide** is _not_ available for MIDI, as the standard doesn't support it

## Page 3: Presets and track settings
- **Save** a preset by holding `[shift]` and selecting on of the 64 preset slots on the top.
- **Load** a preset by tapping one of the preset slots.
- **Delete** a preset by holding `[shift]` and `[mod]` and selecting a preset slot.
- Choose the **playback order** and **clock division** for the corresponding track

## Crow / MIDI

### Crow
Connect crow to control your eurorack system:
- Outputs 1 and 3 send **gates, triggers or envelopes** (adjustable in the params) for each pulse
- Outputs 2 and 4 send **1v/octave** pitch voltage

[0V translates to C4](https://vcvrack.com/manual/VoltageStandards) as the baseline frequency. Notes lower than that get clamped at 0V minimum. Use your oscillator controls to offset the octave.

### MIDI
Connect your MIDI device using the corresponding param. Track 1 defaults to MIDI-Channel 1, Track 2 defaults to MIDI-Channel 2. The Channels can also be assigned in the params.

The possible range for MIDI Note Events is [C1 to G9](https://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies). It's theoretically possible to exceed this limitation with setting a high octave range and a little help from the **accumulating transposition** feature. However, metrix caps the pitch at G9. Nice try. :)

## Params
