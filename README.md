[intellijel Metropolix](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/metropolix/) for norns.

All functionality and terms are directly adopted from metropolix.
Have a look on yt or the Metropolix website for a general functional overview of the sequencer.
Please look at the manual for further explanations if something is unclear.

## Features
- Two independent tracks with 8 stages each
- Control many functions directly via grid (pulse count, gate type, ratchets, pitch, octave, accumulation, slide and accent)
- Set playback direction (forward, reverse, alternate, random) and clock division (1/1 - 1/32) per track
- Loop the whole sequence or choose parts of it
- Quantize to a scale and root note via global params
- Connect to Crow or via MIDI
- Save and load up to 64 presets
- Generate random sequences 

## Requirements
- norns (210114)
- grid
- optional: crow

## Layout
The layout of **metrix** is strongly influenced by [skylines](https://llllllll.co/t/skylines/38856) and Kria. ❤️

### Page Selector
In the bottom left corner, you can choose among the follwing pages:

1. pulses and gates
2. pitch
3. presets and track settings

### Track Selector / Loopy
On pages 1 & 2, use the first two rows to select one of two tracks and to set the loop start and end points:
- Tap on the currently unselected track to select it.
- Hold the start point and select the end point to set the repeating stages.
- Tap on a stage on the currently selected track to select only a single stage.

### Modifier Keys
In the bottom right corner, the `[shift]` and `[mod]` keys are located.
Hold these keys for secondary functions and shortcuts.

#### _shift_
Hold the `[shift]` key to switch to the secondary functions of a page. 
More on that on the corresponding sections.

#### _mod_
Hold the `[mod]` key to access some shortcuts:

- `[mod] + [page 1] / [page 2]`
Randomize the values related to that page
- `[mod] + [value]`
Set all stages to the selected value. Use the shift key additionally to access the secondary functions.
- `[mod] + [track selector]`
Set loopy to repeat all stages of the track

## Page 1: Pulses and gates
- Use the top matrix to choose the pulse count for each stage. 
- Use the bottom matrix to choose the gate type for each stage.
- Press and hold `[shift]` to access the matrices for ratchets (top) and probability (bottom).

## Page 2: Pitch
- Use the top matrix to choose the pitch for each stage. 
- Use the bottom matrix to choose the octave for each stage.
- Press and hold `[shift]` to access the matrices for accumulating transposition (top) and slide on/off.

## Page 3: Presets and track settings
- Save a preset by holding `[shift]` and selecting on of the 64 preset slots on the top.
- Load a preset by tapping one of the preset slots.
- Delete a preset by holding `[shift]` and `[mod]` and select a preset slot.
- Choose the playback order and clock division for the corresponding track

## Crow
Connect crow to control your eurorack system:
- Outputs 1 and 3 send gates, triggers or envelopes (adjustable in the params) for each pulse
- Outputs 2 and 4 send 1v/octave pitch voltage

## Params

### General
Param | Description
----- | ---
Scale | Choose on of the provided scales

Pitch: Acc. Limit | Set the limit over which transpositions are allowed to accumulate
Pitch: Transpose Trigger | Apply the accumulation per stage / pulse / ratchet
Pitch: Slide Time | Sets the amount of time it takes to move from one pitch to the next (Note: Only 'analog' slide type is supported atm.)
MIDI: Channel | Sets the MIDI channel for sending the track sequence to
Crow: Gate Type | Sets the signal type crow generates to gate / trigger / envelope type
Crow: Env. Attack | Sets the attack time of the generated envelope
Crow: Env. Sustain | Sets the sustain time of the generated envelope
Crow: Env. Release | Sets the release time of the generated envelope
